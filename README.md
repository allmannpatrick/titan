# some machine learning models

* The first is a CNN using TensorFlow classifying cats and dogs from 2000 images from the data sets found at https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/cat-dataset and https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data?select=train. The model was trained on a Google Colaboratory GPU with 12GB of RAM. The machine ran out of memory when we tried to increase the data set size or augment it. Efforts to improve this model are ongoing.
* The second is a randomforest model based on the data found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.
